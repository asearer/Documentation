### Guide to Git

Git is a distributed version control system designed to track changes in files and coordinate work on those files among multiple people. Hereâ€™s a detailed guide to using Git:

1. **Installation and Setup:**
   - **Install Git:** Download and install Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
   - **Configure Git:** Set your username and email globally using:
     ```
     git config --global user.name "Your Name"
     git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
     ```

2. **Basic Git Concepts:**
   - **Repository (Repo):** A collection of files and folders under Git version control, including their complete history of changes.
   - **Commit:** A snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time.
   - **Branch:** A parallel version of a repository, allowing you to work on different features or fixes without affecting the main branch.
   - **Remote:** A repository hosted on a server, often on platforms like GitHub or GitLab.

3. **Starting with Git:**
   - **Initialize a Repository:** Create a new Git repository in your project folder:
     ```
     git init
     ```
   - **Checking Status and Staging Changes:**
     ```
     git status  # Check status of files
     git add <file>  # Add changes to staging area
     ```
   - **Committing Changes:**
     ```
     git commit -m "Commit message"
     ```

4. **Working with Branches:**
   - **Create a Branch:**
     ```
     git branch <branch-name>
     ```
   - **Switch to a Branch:**
     ```
     git checkout <branch-name>
     ```
   - **Merge Branches:**
     ```
     git merge <branch-name>
     ```

5. **Collaborating with Git:**
   - **Adding Remotes:**
     ```
     git remote add origin <remote-url>
     ```
   - **Pushing and Pulling Changes:**
     ```
     git push -u origin <branch-name>  # Push changes to remote repository
     git pull origin <branch-name>     # Pull changes from remote repository
     ```

6. **Advanced Git Operations:**
   - **Rebasing:** Incorporate changes from one branch into another:
     ```
     git checkout <branch-name>
     git rebase <base-branch>
     ```
   - **Resetting Changes:** Undo commits or changes:
     ```
     git reset <commit>
     git checkout -- <file>
     ```

7. **Best Practices:**
   - Use descriptive commit messages.
   - Keep commits focused and atomic.
   - Regularly pull changes from the main branch.
   - Follow branching conventions (e.g., feature branches).
